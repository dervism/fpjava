/**
 * This is an improved version using sealed interfaces with 'permits' to
 * limit who can extend this interface. The updated switch-expression allows
 * advanced pattern matching with access to the object properties and methods.
 *
 * Sealed interfaces is an important step forward to better support for
 * algebraic data types in Java, while at the same time making the code safer
 * through exhaustive matching (see code examples below).
 *
 * Notice:
 * Animal is an algebraic data type, more specifically a sum type, because
 * the only ever value it can be is either a Cat or a Dog (or any other
 * value specified in 'permits' here).
