# Functional programming in Java

This repo serves as a place to practice functional programming in Java and to understand functional programming by building minimal versions of known Haskell-concepts in Java. Multiple FP-libraries exist for Java, but building these concepts myself help me learn them better.

The repo uses:
- [x] Sealed classes and interfaces
- [x] Records
- [x] Pattern matching on sealed classes and interfaces (switch)
- [ ] Value types

Todo's:  
- [x] Either a b = Left a | Right b  
- [x] Maybe a = Just a | Nothing  
- [ ] Lenses  
- [ ] Prisms  
- [ ] Traversables  
- [ ] Monads  
- [x] Applicatives
- [x] Functors
- [ ] Monoids  
- [ ] Semigroups  
- [ ] Partial functions

Haskell books I read:  
- [ ] The Haskell Book
- [ ] Haskell in Depth
